### Project Title

Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description

I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I used pandas,numpy and datetime libraries too.
I write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
Users are able to filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data.

### Files used

bikeshare.py
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
chicago.csv

Requirements:
Python 3 with pandas and numpy libraries
